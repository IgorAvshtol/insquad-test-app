## Description

This is my test case. It was necessary to create a CRUD server using a database(postgres in my case), cover it with tests and load it into a docker container.

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start:dev:docker
```

## Test

```bash
# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e:docker
$ npm run test:e2e
```
