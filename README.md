## Description

This is my test case. It was necessary to create a CRUD server using a database(postgres in my case), cover it with tests and load it into a docker container.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e
```
